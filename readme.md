## Notes
* Code to transform and correct observed coordinates is in the [prep_coords](./prep_coords) directory.
* Relative orientation code is in `lab3.py`, which is just the creation and calls to a `RelativeOrientation` object found in `relative_orientation.py`.
* The [lab report](./report/report.md) is in the [report](./report) directory.
